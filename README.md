## DevTools Helper

### Project Overview

`devtools_helper` is an Electron-based desktop application designed to streamline command-line interface (CLI) interactions and other development tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for executing commands, viewing results, and managing common development workflows. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Electron to bridge web technologies with native operating system capabilities.

### Key Features

*   **Command Execution:** Execute arbitrary commands directly from the application's interface.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** View command output (stdout and stderr) in real-time.
*   **Error Handling:** Display error messages for failed commands.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Built with Electron, ensuring compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Clipboard Integration:** Copy command results to the clipboard.
*   **Customizable UI:** The UI is styled with a dark theme, making it visually appealing and easy on the eyes.

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
devtools_helper/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file for the application's UI.
├── main.js         # Main Electron process, handles window creation and IPC.
├── MyIcon.iconset/ # Contains the application icon in various sizes.
├── package.json    # Node.js package manifest, lists dependencies and scripts.
└── README.md       # Project documentation (this file).
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd devtools_helper
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    This command will start the Electron application, displaying the main window.

2.  **Using the Application:**

    *   The application's UI provides input fields for entering commands.
    *   Execute commands by pressing Enter or clicking an "Execute" button (if implemented in the UI).
    *   View the command output in the designated output area.
    *   Copy the output to the clipboard using the provided functionality.

### Dependencies

*   **Electron:**  A framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  Used for creating the application window and managing native OS interactions.
*   **Node.js Modules:**
    *   `path`:  Used for handling file paths.
    *   `child_process`:  Used for executing system commands.
    *   `fs`: Used for file system operations.

### Configuration

The `package.json` file contains the project's metadata, dependencies, and scripts.  Key configurations include:

*   `main`: Specifies the entry point of the Electron application (`main.js`).
*   `scripts`: Defines commands for running, packaging, and testing the application.
